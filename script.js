//Define a function underneath here that is named numberAdder
//numberAdder should take 2 parameters and it should return the sum of those two values
//After you're done, try looking around at the CSS and HTML to 
//see if you understand what's going on :)

function numberAdder(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

/* Seems like the HTML outlines two forms for the numbers
and the CSS customizes the labels, form boxes, and buttons.
Also, in retrospect it makes a lot of sense for CSS to control the cursor shape...
I wonder if there's a way to style that with a custom image to replace the cursor in CSS? */
